## Venture Funding with Deep Learning

Alphabet Soup’s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked us to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

we received a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. With using machine learning and neural networks, we decided to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

## Project Read Map :

The steps for this project are broken out into the following sections:

We Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.

We Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.

We Optimize the neural network model.

## Instalation :

You’ll need to install the following tools for this module:

[TensorFlow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

`pip install --upgrade tensorflow`

[Keras](https://keras.io/about/)

`python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.keras.__version__)"`

Alternatively, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n3LDGKSb1-3SjAol5RDOBDqweC-1uH60).works well with Tensorflow and can be used to run Jupyter Notebook files.
